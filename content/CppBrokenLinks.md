====================================================================

 

[FAQ](CppFaq.htm).

 

Because I let the growth of my pages depend on the demand of my
visitors!

 

I make broken links on purpose. This way, I can see what most visitors
are interested in. Every once in a while I check which non-existing
pages were in highest demand. Then I create those pages. So click those
broken links!
