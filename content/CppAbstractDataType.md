# ([C++](Cpp.md)) [Abstract data type](CppAbstractDataType.md)

'An [abstract data type](CppAbstractDataType.md) is a
[type](CppDataType.md) whose internal form is hidden behind a set of
[access functions](CppAccessor.md). [Objects](CppObject.md) of the
[type](CppDataType.md) are created and inspected only by calls to the
[access functions](CppAccessor.md). This allows the
[implementation](CppImplementation.md) of the [type](CppDataType.md)
to be changed without requiring any changes outside the
[module](CppModule.md) in which it is [defined](CppDefinition.md).'
