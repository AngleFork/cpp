==============================================================

 

'An [abstract data type](CppAbstractDataType.htm) is a
[type](CppDataType.htm) whose internal form is hidden behind a set of
[access functions](CppAccessor.htm). [Objects](CppObject.htm) of the
[type](CppDataType.htm) are created and inspected only by calls to the
[access functions](CppAccessor.htm). This allows the
[implementation](CppImplementation.htm) of the [type](CppDataType.htm)
to be changed without requiring any changes outside the
[module](CppModule.htm) in which it is [defined](CppDefinition.htm).'
