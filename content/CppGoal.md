=====================================================

 

[FAQ](CppFaq.htm).

 

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ` The goal of this website is to be my personal log and reference, satisfying my own quality standards.`
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

I have the following quality standards:

The [C++](Cpp.htm) pages must be able to act as a high quality reference

-   Page text is concise
-   Page text and code contains many links (1)
-   Examples shown must be as simple as possible (but must follow a
    correct coding standard)
-   All pages can be found in a glossary

The [C++](Cpp.htm) pages must be able to act as a source for high
quality code snippets

-   All code snippets must be copy-pastable
-   Useful code snippets are used as examples
-   All code snippets can be found in a glossary
-   High quality coding standard

The [C++](Cpp.htm) pages must use a coding standard following the advice
given by the experts in the literature

-   Use of [STL](CppStl.htm) over other [libraries](CppLibrary.htm)
-   Use of [Boost](CppBoost.htm) over other [libraries](CppLibrary.htm),
    except for the [STL](CppStl.htm)
-   [const-correct](CppConstCorrect.htm)
-   use of [assert](CppAssert.htm)

The [C++](Cpp.htm) pages must show [referenced](CppReferences.htm)
advice given by the experts in the literature

 

\(1) [Kartik Singhal](http://www.k4rtik.wordpress.com) sent me a friendly
email to notify me that have that much links as I have is not considered
good practice. I am aware of this fact and choose to ignore it: as I am
the primary intended audience and because my primary intended audience
likes as much links as possible.
