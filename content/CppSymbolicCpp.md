==================================================

 

[SymbolicC++](CppSymbolicCpp.htm) is a [C++](Cpp.htm)
[library](CppLibrary.htm) of a [computer algebra system](CppCas.htm).

 

As a personal note, the code quality of
[SymbolicC++](CppSymbolicCpp.htm) does not impress me: I had many
compiler warnings when using g++. When fixing these warnings, I think I
fixed a bug. I have tried to contact the auhors, but their email
addresses were invalid. My fixed version of SymbolicC++ can be found in
[the ProjectRichelBilderbeek
GitHub](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/ProjectRichelBilderbeek).
