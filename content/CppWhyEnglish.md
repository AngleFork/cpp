[FAQ](CppFaq.htm).

 

Some people wonder why my site is in English, although I am Dutch and I
do live in The Netherlands.

 

The answer is that only a small minority (6% in March 2009, total visits
7187) of people that visit my page are from The Netherlands. Most visits
are from countries that speak English as a native language or have
English taught in school.
