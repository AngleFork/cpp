==================================

 

[ODE](CppOde.md) ('Open Dynamics Engine') is a [3D](Cpp3d.md)
[physics](CppPhysics.md) [library](CppLibrary.md).

 

It appears to be easy to build [ODE](CppOde.md) under
[Windows](CppWindows.md) with [Visual Studio](CppVisualStudio.md) or
under [Linux](CppLinux.md). Although I succeeded in building the .DLL
and .LIB files, I could not successfully link it to my project.

 

I did not succeed in building [ODE](CppOde.md) under
[Windows](CppWindows.md) with [Qt Creator](CppQtCreator.md), because
of compile errors when static linking to the source.

 

Due to compile errors in a freshly checked-out project I saw the code
and was not impressed. Then I abandoned using this library.
