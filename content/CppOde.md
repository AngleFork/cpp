==================================

 

[ODE](CppOde.htm) ('Open Dynamics Engine') is a [3D](Cpp3d.htm)
[physics](CppPhysics.htm) [library](CppLibrary.htm).

 

It appears to be easy to build [ODE](CppOde.htm) under
[Windows](CppWindows.htm) with [Visual Studio](CppVisualStudio.htm) or
under [Linux](CppLinux.htm). Although I succeeded in building the .DLL
and .LIB files, I could not successfully link it to my project.

 

I did not succeed in building [ODE](CppOde.htm) under
[Windows](CppWindows.htm) with [Qt Creator](CppQtCreator.htm), because
of compile errors when static linking to the source.

 

Due to compile errors in a freshly checked-out project I saw the code
and was not impressed. Then I abandoned using this library.
