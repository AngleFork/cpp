=============================================================

 

The [genetic algorithm](CppGeneticAlgorithm.md) is 'a search heuristic
that mimics the process of natural evolution. This heuristic is
routinely used to generate useful solutions to optimization and search
problems. Genetic algorithms belong to the larger class of evolutionary
algorithms (EA), which generate solutions to optimization problems using
techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation,
selection, and crossover' \[1\].
