=========================================================

 

A [coding standard](CppCodingStandard.htm) is 'a set of rules or
guidelines used when writing the source code for a computer program. It
is often claimed that following a particular programming style will help
programmers to read and understand source code conforming to the style,
and help to avoid introducing errors' \[1\].

 

The table of contents of \[2\] is already the summary of an excellent
[coding standard](CppCodingStandard.htm), and it can be found at [the
book's homepage](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c++cs.htm).
