# ([C++](Cpp.md)) [Coding standard](CppCodingStandard.md)

A [coding standard](CppCodingStandard.md) is 'a set of rules or
guidelines used when writing the source code for a computer program. It
is often claimed that following a particular programming style will help
programmers to read and understand source code conforming to the style,
and help to avoid introducing errors' [1].

The table of contents of [2] is already the summary of an excellent
[coding standard](CppCodingStandard.md), and it can be found at [the
book's homepage](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/c++cs.md).

A [coding stle](CppCodingStyle.md) may be used to designate part of a [coding standard](CppCodingStandard.md)
that handles stylistic issues. For example, the Qt library has a general coding standard [4], and a
specific style to do so [3].
