========================================

 

[OpenCL](CppOpenCl.md) (an abbreviation of 'Open Computer Language') is
a cross-platform [library](CppLibrary.md) to communication with CPU's,
GPU's and other processors.

 

[OpenCL](CppOpenCl.md) appears very closed-source like.

 

It appears that [Bullet](CppBullet.md) can depend on
[OpenCL](CppOpenCl.md).
