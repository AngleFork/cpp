=========================================================

 

[Wine](CppWine.htm) is a [system environent (which in my definition is
sort of an operating system)](CppOs.htm), as it (does not)
[emulates](CppEmulate.htm) a Windows environment under Linux, to [run
Windows under Wine under Ubuntu](CppWineUbuntu.htm). Among others,
[Wine](CppWine.htm) can be used to (in some definitions)
[port](CppPort.htm) programs from Linux to Windows.

 

The answer to the [Qt FAQ](CppQtFaq.htm) [Can Qt Creator run under Wine
under Ubuntu?](CppQtCreatorWineUbuntu.htm) seems to be no, however.
