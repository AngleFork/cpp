===============================================================

 

[Hungarian notation](CppHungarianNotation.md) is a coding convention to
put information about the [date type](CppDataType.md) in an
[identifier](CppIdentifier.md), which might be useful in weakly-typed
or untyped languages (most notably C).

 

Avoid using [Hungarian notation](CppHungarianNotation.md) \[1-3\].

    glossary](http://www.stroustrup.com/glossary.html): 'Hungarian
    notation - a coding convention that encodes type information in
    variable names. Its main use is to compensate for lack of type
    checking in weakly-typed or untyped languages. It is totally
    unsuitable for C++ where it complicates maintenance and gets in the
    way of abstraction'
