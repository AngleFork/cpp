==================================================================

 

[Wt deployment](CppWtDeploy.htm) is 'changing a [Wt](CppWt.htm)
application to a webpage'.

 

There are two types of [Wt deployment](CppWtDeploy.htm): local and
global:

-   ![OKAY](PicGreen.png) [Local Wt deployment](CppWtDeployLocal.htm)
    denotes running a [Wt](CppWt.htm) application in a browser on the
    same machine it has been developed on, without the need of internet
    access. [Local Wt deployment](CppWtDeployLocal.htm) is described at
    the [Hello Wt](CppHelloWt.htm) page.
-   ![?OKAY](PicYellow.png) [Global Wt
    deployment](CppWtDeployGlobal.htm) denotes running a [Wt](CppWt.htm)
    application from a server, so possibly everybody with internet
    access can view it.
