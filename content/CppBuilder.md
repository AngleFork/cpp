==============================================

 

[C++ Builder](CppBuilder.md) is a [Windows-only](CppWindows.md)
[C++](Cpp.md) [IDE](CppIde.md) that uses the [VCL](CppVcl.md)
[library](CppLibrary.md) for [GUI](CppGui.md) development.

 

Because I have moved to the cross-platform [Qt
Creator](CppQtCreator.md) [IDE](CppIde.md), I will not work a lot on
the [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.md) pages anymore.

 

Nowadays [C++ Builder](CppBuilder.md) is called 'Borland Developer
Studio', 'Turbo C++ Explorer' or RAD Studio .
