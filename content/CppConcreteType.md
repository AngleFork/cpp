=====================================================

 

'A [concrete type](CppConcreteType.md) is a [type](CppType.md) without
[virtual](CppVirtual.md) [functions](CppFunction.md), so that
[objects](CppObject.md) of the [type](CppType.md) can be
[allocated](CppAllocate.md) on the [stack](CppStack.md) and
manipulated directly (without a need to use [pointers](CppPointer.md)
or [references](CppReference.md) to allow the possibility for [derived
classes](CppDerivedClass.md)). Often, small self-contained
[classes](CppClass.md).' \[1\]
