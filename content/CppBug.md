==================================

 

A [bug](CppBug.htm) is a [runtime error](CppRuntimeError.htm).

 

Removing [bugs](CppBug.htm) is called [debugging](CppDebug.htm).

 

 

 

 

 

Different kind of [bugs](CppBug.htm)
------------------------------------

 

My favorites from [The Dodgy
Coder](http://www.dodgycoder.net/2011/11/yoda-conditions-pokemon-exception.html):

 

-   Heisenbug: a [bug](CppBug.htm) that disappears or alters its
    characteristics when an attempt is made to study it
-   Higgs-Bugson: a hypothetical [bug](CppBug.htm) predicted to exist
    based on a small number of possibly related event log entries and
    vague anecdotal reports from users, but it is difficult (if
    not impossible) to reproduce on a dev machine because you don't
    really know if it's there, and if it is there what is causing it. To
    find these you will need to invest in a Large Hadron debugger
-   Schrödinbug: refers to a function/feature that appears to fluctuate
    between buggy and correct (like Schrödinger's cat, fluctuating
    between alive and dead), until somebody looks at the source code
    (opens the box), at which point it becomes permanently bugged
-   Loch Ness Monster Bug: a [bug](CppBug.htm) which cannot be
    reproduced or has only been sighted by one person
-   UFO bug: a [bug](CppBug.htm) presented by customers, who, even when
    they're shown that it doesn't exist, will repeatedly report it again
    and again, believing it is real
-   Mandelbug: a [bug](CppBug.htm) whose causes are so complex that its
    behavior appears chaotic or even non-deterministic. Named after
    fractal innovator Benoît Mandelbrot
-   Brown-paper-bag bug: a [bug](CppBug.htm) in a public software
    release that is so embarrassing that the author notionally wears a
    brown paper bag over his head for a while
-   Sorcerer's apprentice mode bug: a [bug](CppBug.htm) in a protocol
    where, under some circumstances, the receipt of a message causes
    multiple messages to be sent, each of which, when received, triggers
    the same bug
-   Mad girlfriend bug: a [bug](CppBug.htm) whose immediate effect
    remains hidden - the app outwardly seems to function normally and
    tells you that everything is fine
-   Excalibur bug: when all of the developers within a company have
    tried to fix a particular [bug](CppBug.htm) but none have succeeded,
    so far
-   Load-bearing [printf](CppPrintf.htm) bug: when a line of debug
    output is required for the code to work - the code does not function
    if you remove it
