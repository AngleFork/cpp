===========================================

 

[Run time](CppRunTime.md) is the the time that the program runs, which
can take place after [compile time](CppCompileTime.md) and [link
time](CppLinkTime.md).

 

The technique to improve [run time](CppRunTime.md) speed is called
[profiling](CppProfile.md).
