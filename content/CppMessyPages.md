===============================================================

 

[FAQ](CppFaq.htm).

 

Once I used MS Word as a HTML editor. Now I want my pages in the XHTML
markup language. Due to this, I started caring about the clutter MS Word
adds. Using KFileReplace, I removed as much clutter as possible, opening
up some markup errors.

 

Some of my activity in cleaning up messy pages can be seen at the
[recent changes](CppRecentChanges.htm): I often add the description
'improved page source'.
