============================================================

 

My own favorite [C++](Cpp.md) [VCL](CppVcl.md) code snippets. Note
that some snippets fall under multiple categories. Some snippets are
trivial for most people, but I put them here for completeness and for
newbies (including my own students).

 

For STL and Boost code snippets, [go to the (standard) code snippets
page](CppCodeSnippets.md).

 

I cite my sources whenever someone else published a version of the
snippet before me, although I have always modified the original. All
snippets should compile cleanly after a copy-paste. Feel free to contact
me when one snippet does not ([view my E-mail address](Email.png)).
