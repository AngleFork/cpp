==============================================================

 

Difficulty: 2/10

Date added: 24th of June 2008

 

In this [exercise](CppExercise.htm), you learn that different ways to
the same solution, yield different execution speeds.

 

Below is a [declaration](CppDeclaration.htm) of a
[function](CppFunction.htm) to add one to every [int](CppInt.htm) in a
[std::vector](CppVector.htm):

 

  --------------------------------------
  ` void AddOne(std::vector<int>& v);`
  --------------------------------------

 

There are many ways to do this.

 

Question \#0: How many correct ways are there to do this? Hint: more
than 10.

 

Question \#1: Write a program that tests which way is fastest
