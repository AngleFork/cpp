=========================================================

 

A [regression test](CppRegressionTest.htm) is a type of
[test](CppTest.htm) to ensure that new changes in your code did not
break (regress) other parts of the code.

 

[Testing](CppRegressionTest.htm) is the process of validating your code.

 

Thorough [regression testing](CppRegressionTest.htm) is expensive but
essential; the appropriate time to create thorough [regression
tests](CppRegressionTest.htm) is tied to the stability of the subsystem
to be tested' \[1\].
