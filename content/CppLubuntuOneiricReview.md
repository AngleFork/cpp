([C++](Cpp.htm)) ![Lubuntu](PicLubuntu.png) [Lubuntu Oneiric Ocelot review](CppLubuntuOneiricReview.htm)
========================================================================================================

 

[Lubuntu Oneiric Ocelot review](CppLubuntuOneiricReview.htm) is a review
of the Oneiric Ocelot version of [Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm).

 

 

 

 

 

![Mac](PicMac.png)![Windows](PicWindows.png)![to](PicTo.png)![Ubuntu](PicUbuntu.png) History: From [Mac](CppMac.htm) and [Windows](CppWindows.htm) to ![Ubuntu](PicUbuntu.png)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

[Ubuntu](CppUbuntu.htm) was my first step into [Linux](CppLinux.htm)
from both [Mac](CppMac.htm) and [Windows](CppWindows.htm). My first
[Ubuntu](CppUbuntu.htm) distribution was Karmic Koala. I liked the
user-friendly graphical user interface of [Ubuntu](CppUbuntu.htm) and
its quick access to the command line. I was happy to set the GUI to
'quick' instead of 'beautiful'. As a programmer I especially enjoy the
package management from the Ubuntu Software Center and Synaptic and
apt-get.

 

 

 

 

 

![Ubuntu](PicUbuntu.png)![to](PicTo.png)![Lubuntu](PicLubuntu.png) History: from Ubuntu Maverick Meerkat to Lubuntu Natty Narwhal
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

In May 2011 the [Ubuntu](CppUbuntu.htm) version Natty Narwhal was
released, with a new graphical user interface called Unity. I tried to
master Unity for a month: as the Desktop wallpaper I put a keyboard
shortcut reference guide. Yet after a month, I could not access my
programs as fast as I would like to and I decided to look for other
\*buntu distributions. I discovered [Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm) Natty
Narwhal.

 

[Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm) Natty Narwhal had a simple graphical user
interface. The response of this GUI was so quick, I had to re-adept to
this speed (similar as making the switch from [Windows](CppWindows.htm)
XP to [Ubuntu](CppUbuntu.htm)).

 

[Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm) Natty Narwhal had its issues: watching YouTube
could possibly freeze the entire system and a hard boot would be needed
to resolve this. Additionally, I failed to connect to a wireless
network: it was too difficult for me. But due to the fast and simple
graphical user interface, I accepted these issues.

 

 

 

 

 

![Lubuntu](PicLubuntu.png) From Natty Narwhal to Oneiric Ocelot
---------------------------------------------------------------

 

In October 2011 the [Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm) version Oneiric Ocelot was
released. This release would be its first release after
[Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm) was accepted as an official \*buntu
distribution: there would be a focus on improving the quality of the
previous version, instead of adding new features.

 

In [Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm) Oneiric Ocelot the problems I had with
Natty Natwhal are resolved: YouTube does not freeze the system anymore
and connecting to a wireless network had become easy! Except for this,
the user interface remained unchanged (except for a different main menu
graphic), so I lost no time finding my way again.

 

[Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm) Oneiric Ocelot does have some small issues
now:

-   In gedit, the cursor is not always visible
-   When pressing SUPER-R to start the Run window, this window is not
    put into focus

The first issue can be solved easily: in the gedit Preferences, select
to highlight the current line and the cursor will always be visible. The
second issue is annoying, but I guess it will be easy to fix.

 

 

 

 

 

 

![Lubuntu](PicLubuntu.png) Conclusion
-------------------------------------

 

The upgrade from [Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm) Natty Narwhal to
[Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm) Oneiric Ocelot brough me big advantages
(YouTube and connection to wireless networks), took me no time to get to
know the near-identical graphical user interface, and yielded one new
small annoyances.

 

For me, [Lubuntu](CppLubuntu.htm) Oneiric Ocelot was a step forward in a
direction I liked.
