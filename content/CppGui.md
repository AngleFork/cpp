==================================

 

[GUI](CppGui.md) is an abbreviation of 'Graphical User Interface'.
Console applications do not have a [GUI](CppGui.md), programs running
in windows do.

 

Some [libraries](CppLibrary.md) for [GUI](CppGui.md) design are
[QT](CppQt.md) (cross-platform) and [VCL](CppVcl.md) (Windows).
