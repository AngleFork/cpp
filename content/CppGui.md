==================================

 

[GUI](CppGui.htm) is an abbreviation of 'Graphical User Interface'.
Console applications do not have a [GUI](CppGui.htm), programs running
in windows do.

 

Some [libraries](CppLibrary.htm) for [GUI](CppGui.htm) design are
[QT](CppQt.htm) (cross-platform) and [VCL](CppVcl.htm) (Windows).
