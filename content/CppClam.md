====================================

 

[CLAM](CppClam.md) is a free [C++](Cpp.md) [audio](CppAudio.md)
[library](CppLibrary.md).

 

[CLAM](CppClam.md) is [licenced](CppLicence.md) under GPL 2.0 \[1\],
so it is free. As long as the programs you develop are licenced under
GPL as well, using [CLAM](CppClam.md) is legal as well.

 

Under Ubuntu, [CLAM](CppClam.md) cannot be installed from Ubuntu's
Software Center. From the [CLAM](CppClam.md) homepage, however, one can
download libclam-doc\_1.4.0-1\_all.deb (from karmic only) to install
[CLAM](CppClam.md) easily.

 

I did not succeed in producing a simple beep in [CLAM](CppClam.md).
