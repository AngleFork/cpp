# FAQ

## Why are so many pages messy?

Due to the history of these pages.

These pages originated from [http://www.richelbilderbeek.nl](http://www.richelbilderbeek.nl) and were plain HTML.
I converted these pages to Markdown using pandoc.
pandoc is great, but not perfect.

## Why do all pages start with `Cpp`?

Due to the history of these pages.

These pages originated from [http://www.richelbilderbeek.nl](http://www.richelbilderbeek.nl), where there
are multiple sections, with different prefixes.

## Why don't you remove the `Cpp` prefix?

Because all links from many repositories would break.
