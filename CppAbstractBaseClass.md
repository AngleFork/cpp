([C++](Cpp.htm)) [Abstract base class](CppAbstractBaseClass.htm)
================================================================

 

An [abstract base class](CppAbstractBaseClass.htm) (abbreviated to
'ABC') is a type of [abstract class](CppAbstractClass.htm) and a type of
[base class](CppBaseClass.htm).

 

'An [abstract base class](CppAbstractBaseClass.htm) is a
[class](CppClass.htm) from which no [objects](CppObject.htm) may be
created; it is only used as a [base class](CppBaseClass.htm) for the
[derivation](CppDerivedClass.htm) of other [classes](CppClass.htm). A
[class](CppClass.htm) is abstract if it includes at least one [member
function](CppMemberFunction.htm) that is [declared](CppDeclaration.htm)
as pure [virtual](CppVirtual.htm).' \[2\]

 

 

 

 

[Advice](CppAdvice.htm)
-----------------------

 

-   Use an [abstract base class](CppAbstractBaseClass.htm) to represent
    something common to some, but not all, classes in a hierarchy \[1\]
